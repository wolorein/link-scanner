link-scanner
============

A simple tornado(python) web service which scans download links with yara.

This project shows how easy to use yara. It is a simple to use and a realy great malware scanner for python.
The service based on a tornado server where the link could be inserted for scan.

Dependancies:
-Python 2.7.5
-urllib2
-tornado
-yara

For yara rules i used Jaime Blasco's AlienvaultLabs apt1.yara and yara converter
